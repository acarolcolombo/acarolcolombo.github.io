      <p>
Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that causes
meningoencephalitis. There are no prophylactic tools for cryptococcosis.
Previously, our group showed that a C. neoformans mutant lacking the gene
encoding sterylglucosidase (Δsgl1) induced protection in both
immunocompetent and immunocompromised murine models of cryptococcosis.
Since sterylglucosidase catalyzes degradation of sterylglucosides (SGs),
accumulation of this glycolipid could be responsible for protective
immunity. In this study, we analyzed whether the activity of SGs is
sufficient for the protective effect induced by the Δsgl1 strain. We
observed that the accumulation of SGs impacted several properties of the
main polysaccharide that composes the fungal capsule, glucuronoxylomannan
(GXM). We therefore used genetic manipulation to delete the SGL1 gene in
the acapsular mutant Δcap59 to generate a double mutant (strain
Δcap59/Δsgl1) that was shown to be nonpathogenic and cleared from the
lung of mice within 7 days post-intranasal infection. The inflammatory
immune response triggered by the Δcap59/Δsgl1 mutant in the lung differed
from the response seen with the other strains. The double mutant did not
induce protection in a vaccination model, suggesting that SG-related
protection requires the main capsular polysaccharide. Finally,
GXM-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in SGs delayed the
acute lethality of Galleria mellonella against C. neoformans infection.
These studies highlighted a key role for GXM and SGs in inducing
protection against a secondary cryptococcal infection, and, since EVs
notoriously contain GXM, these results suggest the potential use of Δsgl1
EVs as a vaccination strategy for cryptococcosis.
</p>
<p>
<b>IMPORTANCE:</b> The number of deaths from cryptococcal meningitis is
around 180,000 per year. The disease is the second leading cause of
mortality among individuals with AIDS. Antifungal treatment is costly and
associated with adverse effects and resistance, evidencing the urgency of
development of both therapeutic and prophylactic tools. Here we
demonstrate the key roles of polysaccharide- and glycolipid-containing
structures in a vaccination model to prevent cryptococcosis.

      <p>
Catalepsy – an immobile state in which individuals fail to change imposed
postures – can be induced by haloperidol. In rats, the pattern of
haloperidol-induced catalepsy is very similar to that observed in
Parkinson’s disease (PD). As some PD symptoms seem to depend on the
patient’s emotional state, and as anxiety disorders are common in PD, it
is possible that the central mechanisms regulating emotional and
cataleptic states interplay. Previously, we showed that haloperidol
impaired contextual-induced alarm calls in rats, without affecting
footshock-evoked calls. Here, we evaluated the influence of distinct
aversive stimulations on the haloperidol-induced catalepsy. First, male
Wistar rats were subjected to catalepsy tests to establish a baseline
state after haloperidol or saline administration. Next, distinct cohorts
were exposed to open-field; elevated plus-maze; open-arm confinement;
inescapable footshocks; contextual conditioned fear; or corticosterone
administration. Subsequently, catalepsy tests were performed again.
Haloperidol-induced catalepsy was verified in all drug-treated animals.
Exposure to open-field, elevated plus-maze, open-arm confinement,
footshocks, or administration of corticosterone had no significant effect
on haloperidol-induced catalepsy. Contextual conditioned fear, which is
supposed to promote a more intense fear, increased catalepsy over time.
Our findings suggest that only specific defensive circuitries modulate
the nigrostriatal system mediating the haloperidol-induced cataleptic
state.

Flippases are responsible for the asymmetric distribution of phospholipids
in biological membranes. In the encapsulated fungal pathogen Cryptococcus
neoformans, the putative flippase Apt1 is an important regulator of
polysaccharide secretion and pathogenesis in mice by unknown mechanisms.
In this study, we analyzed the role of C. neoformans Apt1 in intracellular
membrane architecture and synthesis of polysaccharide and lipids.
Analysis of wild type (WT), apt1Δ (mutant) and apt1Δ::APT1 (complemented)
strains by transmission electron microscopy revealed that deletion of
APT1 resulted in the formation of irregular vacuoles. Disorganization
of vacuolar membranes in apt1Δ cells was accompanied by a significant
increase in the amounts of intra-vacuolar and pigment-containing vesicles.
Quantitative immunogold labeling of C. neoformans cells with a monoclonal
antibody raised to a major capsular component suggested impaired
polysaccharide synthesis. APT1 deletion also affected synthesis of
phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine, inositolphosphoryl ceramide,
glucosylceramide and ergosterylglycoside. These results reveal novel functions
of Apt1 and are in agreement with the notion that this putative flippase plays
an important role in the physiology of C. neoformans.

A reduction of dopamine release or D2 receptor blockade in the terminal
fields of the mesolimbic system, particularly the amygdala, clearly reduces
conditioned fear. Similar D2 receptor antagonism in the neural substrates
of fear in the midbrain tectum attenuates the processing of unconditioned
aversive information. However, the implications of the interplay between
opposing actions of dopamine in the rostral and caudal segments of the
dopaminergic system are still unclear. Previous studies from this laboratory
have reported the effects of dopaminergic drugs on behavior in rats in the
elevated plus maze, auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) recorded from the
midbrain tectum, fear-potentiated startle, and conditioned freezing. These
findings led to an interesting framework on the functional roles of dopamine
in both anxiety and fear states. Dopamine D2 receptor inhibition in the
terminal fields of the mesolimbic dopamine system generally causes
anxiolytic-like effects, whereas the activity of midbrain substrates of
unconditioned fear are enhanced by D2 receptor antagonists, suggesting
that D2 receptor-mediated mechanisms play opposing roles in fear/anxiety
processes, depending on the brain region under study. Dopamine appears to
mediate conditioned fear by acting at rostral levels of the brain and regulate
unconditioned fear at the midbrain level, likely by reducing the sensorimotor
gating of aversive events.

Brain infection by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans results in an
estimated 500,000 human deaths per annum. Colonization of the central
nervous system (CNS) by C. neoformans causes different clinical syndromes
that involve interaction of a number of fungal components with distinct
brain cells. In this manuscript, our literature review confirmed the
notion that the Cryptococcus field is expanding rapidly, but also
suggested that studies on neuropathogenesis still represent a small
fraction of basic research activity in the field. We therefore discussed
anatomical and physiological aspects of the brain during infection by C.
neoformans, in addition to mechanisms by which brain resident cells interact
with the fungus. This review suggests that multiple efforts are necessary
to improve the knowledge on how C. neoformans affects brain cells, in order
to enable the generation of new therapeutic tools in a near future.

Background
A reduction of dopamine release or D2 receptor blockade in the terminal
fields of the mesolimbic system clearly reduces conditioned fear. Injections of
haloperidol, a preferential D2 receptor antagonist, into the inferior colliculus
(IC) enhance the processing of unconditioned aversive information. However, a
clear characterization of the interplay of D2 receptors in the mediation of
unconditioned and conditioned fear is still lacking.
Methods
The present study investigated the effects of intra-IC injections of the
D2 receptor-selective antagonist sulpiride on behavior in the elevated plus maze
(EPM), auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) to loud sounds recorded from the IC,
fear-potentiated startle (FPS), and conditioned freezing.
Results
Intra-IC injections of sulpiride caused clear proaversive effects in the EPM
and enhanced AEPs induced by loud auditory stimuli. Intra-IC sulpiride
administration did not affect FPS or conditioned freezing.
Conclusions
Dopamine D2-like receptors of the inferior colliculus play a role in the
modulation of unconditioned aversive information but not in the fear-potentiated
startle response.

      <p>
Haloperidol is a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist that induces catalepsy when
systemically administered to rodents. The haloperidol-induced catalepsy is a
state of akinesia and rigidity very similar to that seen in Parkinson's disease.
There exists great interest in knowing whether or not some degree of emotionality
underlies catalepsy. If so, what kind of emotional distress would permeate such
motor disturbance? This study is an attempt to shed some light on this issue
through an analysis of ultrasound vocalizations (USVs) of 22 kHz, open-field
test, and contextual conditioned fear in rats with some degree of catalepsy
induced by haloperidol. Systemic administration of haloperidol caused catalepsy
and decreased exploratory activity in the open-field. There was no difference
in the emission of USVs between groups during the catalepsy or the exploratory
behavior in the open-field test. In the contextual conditioned fear, when
administered before training session, haloperidol did not change the emission
of USVs or the freezing response. When administered before testing session,
haloperidol enhanced the freezing response and decreased the emission of USVs
on the test day. These findings suggest that the involvement of dopaminergic
mechanisms in threatening situations depends on the nature of the aversive
stimulus. Activation of D2 receptors occurs in the setting up of adaptive
responses to conditioned fear stimuli so that these mechanisms seem to be
important for the emission of 22 kHz USVs during the testing phase of the
contextual conditioned fear, but not during the training session or the
open-field test (unconditioned fear stimuli). Catalepsy, on the other hand,
is the result of the blockage of D2 receptors in neural circuits associated
to motor behavior that appears to be dissociated from those directly linked
to dopamine-mediated neural mechanisms associated to fear.
